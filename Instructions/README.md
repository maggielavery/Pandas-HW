This project seeks to analyze the data for the fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli. Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. I have generated a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
